# CLAUDE.md

Context for Claude Code when working in this repo. Read this before making changes.

## What this is

A fantasy sports web app for the **PWHL (Professional Women's Hockey League)**, targeting
the **2026-27 season** (12 teams after the Detroit/Hamilton/Las Vegas/San Jose expansion).
Users create leagues, draft real PWHL players the week before the season opener, set
lineups, and compete in weekly head-to-head matchups scored from real game stats.

## Hard constraints / things that bite

1. **No official PWHL fantasy API.** All real-world data flows through the `StatsSource`
   interface in `lib/ingestion/source.ts`. Never call a stats provider directly from
   app code — go through that interface. The concrete source is TBD; build against a mock.
2. **Season start date is not yet official.** Code assumes a ~Nov 2026 opener and a draft
   ~1 week prior. Don't hardcode dates; read them from `FantasyLeague.draftStartsAt` and
   `Game.startsAt`.
3. **Fantasy points are never stored as source of truth.** Always compute from raw
   `StatLine` rows via `lib/scoring`. Cached scores (e.g. `Matchup.homeScore`) are
   recomputable. This lets leagues change scoring rules without data loss.
4. **The live draft room is the highest-risk feature.** Concurrency, a pick clock, and
   every league drafting the same week. Build and load-test it first.
5. Keep **league data** (Team/Player/Game/StatLine) and **fantasy data** (FantasyLeague/
   FantasyTeam/Roster/Draft/Matchup) cleanly separated. League data is read-only to users.

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- PostgreSQL + Prisma (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Real-time draft: WebSockets (e.g. a small Node ws server or a hosted realtime service)
- Auth: prefer a provider; only use `User.passwordHash` if rolling your own

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev            # start dev server
npx prisma migrate dev # apply schema changes
npx prisma studio      # inspect the DB
npm run seed           # load mock teams/players/games for development
npm test               # run tests (scoring engine has the most important coverage)
```

## Build order (matches the launch timeline)

1. Scaffold + schema + auth + seed data ✅
2. Roster ingestion pipeline (against mock source) + scoring engine ✅ (scoring done)
3. **Draft room** ✅ server logic done — see `lib/draft/`. Frontend still to build.
4. Live scoring loop: matchups, standings, waivers, trades
5. Integration + load test the draft room + beta
6. Public launch ~early Nov, drafts ~1 week before opener

## Draft module (`lib/draft/`)

The server is the single source of truth. Clients only send "pick player X" and
render broadcast state — they never run the clock or decide whose turn it is.

- `snake.ts` — pure snake-order generator + rounds-from-roster helper.
- `messages.ts` — the websocket wire contract (client/server message types).
- `engine.ts` — pure reducer `(state, action) -> { state, effects }`. ALL draft
  rules live here (turn validation, taken-player checks, timeout auto-pick,
  completion). No IO, so it's fully unit-tested in `tests/draft.test.ts`.
- `server.ts` — IO layer: `ws` sockets + the real timer + Prisma persistence.
  Performs the effects the engine returns; swap `broadcast`/sockets for a hosted
  realtime service without touching the engine.

Run locally: `npm run draft-server` (ws://localhost:8080?league=<id>). The clock
is server-side and absolute (`expiresAt` epoch ms); a client disconnect can't
stall the draft because TIMEOUT auto-picks on the server. Every pick persists
immediately, so a server restart rebuilds state via `buildEngineState()`.

## Conventions

- Validate `scoringSettings` / `rosterSettings` JSON shape in app code; don't trust the DB.
- All external data is upserted by `externalId` so re-imports are idempotent.
- Test the scoring engine thoroughly — it's pure and easy to test, and it's the core.
