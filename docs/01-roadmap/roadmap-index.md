# PWHL GM Product Roadmap — Index

Last Updated: June 23, 2026 (Sprint 19 planned — 8 items from Playwright UX walkthrough; BF-018, UX-051–057, BF-019)

## What Is This?

This document serves as the source of truth for future development priorities. Detailed feature cards live in [roadmap-features.md](roadmap-features.md); sprint plans and history live in [roadmap-sprints.md](roadmap-sprints.md).

**When choosing what to build next:**

1. Prioritize unfinished items in the current phase before moving to later phases.
2. Favor user-facing functionality over technical optimization unless stability is at risk.
3. Build for the live season first. Historical Replay is a testing/QA tool, not the product — don't let replay requirements shape or slow down live-season features.
4. New features should not break replay mode, but they do not need to be designed around it.

---

## Product Vision

PWHL GM is the premier fantasy platform for Professional Women's Hockey League fans.

The flagship experience is the live fantasy season: drafting real players, setting weekly lineups, and competing in matchups scored from real PWHL games.

The platform should support:

- Live fantasy leagues (the core product)
- Commissioner customization
- Deep roster management
- Long-term league retention

Historical Replay is an internal/QA tool that lets us exercise the full season loop against completed seasons before live data exists. It is valuable for user testing and dev iteration, but it is not a user-facing flagship and should not be prioritized as one.

---

## Current State

Implemented systems include:

- Authentication & user accounts
- League creation & management (commissioner admin panel: team management, draft setup, season controls, announcements)
- Draft room (live WebSocket draft, queue, auto-draft, auto-escalation)
- Rosters & lineups (locking, play-lock rule, games-remaining badges, projected FPTS)
- Matchups (VTF regular season + 1v1 playoffs) & Matchup Center / Fantasy Home (hero scores, top performers, swing players, storyline chip, playing-tonight, roster breakdown)
- Projections & Win Probability engine
- Standings (with playoff race clinch/eliminate indicators)
- Playoffs (seeding, bracket, single-elimination, full playoff experience UX — bracket-as-primary-landing, elimination/clinch/champion activity events, champion banner, between-round lineup nudge)
- Historical Replay & Season advancement / lifecycle (gap-week handling fixed; "⏩ Sim to playoffs" button scores all remaining regular-season weeks in one click; replay league matchup generation & simulator scoring fixed commit 52ea547)
- Schedule management & scoring engine (VTF point scoring)
- Victory Point (VP) scoring model (win/placement bonuses, `homeVP`/`awayVP`)
- Free-agent add/drop (immediate)
- Live score polling (client-side refresh during active matchups)
- Season-long head-to-head (rivalry) records
- Commissioner Recovery Tools (force roster move, undo transaction, replace inactive manager)
- Commissioner Admin Center (audit log visibility, draft pause visibility, season renewal entry point)
- Draft Analytics (6 events instrumented)
- League Creation UX (8-team recommendation)
- In-app notifications (all three MVP-critical types)
- Founder Operations Console (`/founder/`) — cross-league monitoring, simulation launcher, end-to-end validator; `FOUNDER_EMAILS` env-var auth gate; no schema change
- Auto-Set Lineup (`#34`) — `computeOptimalLineup()` in `lib/lineup.ts`; staged save model; "Auto-set" button in lineup manager; FA suggestions API (`GET /api/leagues/[leagueId]/fa-suggestions`); playoff period fallback for games-remaining badges
- FA Schedule Awareness + Add & Slot (`#35`) — games-remaining "Wk" badge on every FA row (roster page); `AddAndSlotModal` lets managers immediately slot a new pickup into an active position after adding; locked FAs skip the modal
- Beta Feedback Infrastructure (`#36`) — in-app feedback widget (`components/FeedbackWidget.tsx`) mounted on all authenticated layouts; `POST /api/feedback` persists submissions; `GET /api/founder/feedback` + Founder Console feed table; `PATCH /api/founder/leagues/[leagueId]/beta-status`; `FeedbackSubmission` model + `FeedbackType` / `BetaStatus` enums + `betaStatus` on `FantasyLeague`
- Pre-Beta Code Audit + P0/P1 Fixes (`#37`) — staff-engineer-level audit complete (`docs/04-operations/pre-beta-audit.md`); all P0 + P1 findings resolved: renewal atomicity (`$transaction`), draft pick P2002 handling, `onTimeout()` re-entrancy guard, force-move play-lock enforcement (both paths), playoff scoring documented, undo-waiver P2002 → 409. Go/No-Go: ✅ GREEN
- Waiver Wire System (`#5`) — full waiver layer on top of instant add/drop: rolling priority order (reverse VP-standings), 48h waiver window for dropped players, daily batch processing. Schema: `WaiverEntry` / `WaiverClaim` / `WaiverPriority` models + `WaiverStatus` enum + 4 new `EventType` values + `waiverWindowHours` on `FantasyLeague`. Service: `lib/services/waiver-service.ts` (`initializeWaiverPriority`, `enterWaiverWire`, `submitClaim`, `processWaivers`). UI: `WaiverWirePanel.tsx` in roster page "Waiver Wire" tab; "On Waivers" badge in FA table. Ops: `scripts/process-waivers.ts` cron script + founder console trigger. 13 new tests (174 total). FAAB deferred to Sprint 7.
- League-Wide Matchup Storylines (`#11`) — auto-generated weekly highlight cards on the league overview after each week scores. `lib/services/storyline-service.ts`: `computeWeeklyStorylines()` (pure, tested) + `emitWeeklyStorylines()` (IO, fire-and-forget from `advanceSeason()`). Three storyline types: `closest_match`, `high_score`, `player_standout`. `LEAGUE_STORYLINE` EventType in schema. `components/WeekHighlights.tsx` renders cards server-side on `/league/[leagueId]/`. 173-line test suite in `tests/storyline.test.ts`.
- Emotional Design System (Sprint 16) — matchup page emotional energy: score colors by win state (#34d399 green / #f87171 red), animated count-up (0→value over 1.2s), section heading hierarchy (14px normal vs 12px uppercase), Saira Condensed font loading from Google Fonts, RecapCard elevation (colored borders, contextual copy), card entrance animations (fadeSlideUp + stagger), win probability bar spring easing. Transforms "Bloomberg terminal" flatness into engaging sports product. Files: `app/globals.css` (font import + animations), `app/team/[teamId]/matchup/page.tsx` (score colors + RecapCard redesign + section headings), `components/ScoreDisplay.tsx` (count-up animation client component). No schema changes. 149 tests pass.

These systems should be considered core platform functionality.

## MVP Definition & Launch Gates

MVP proves a league can go **Create → Invite → Draft → Set Lineups → Compete → Make Playoffs → Crown Champion** with no commissioner intervention or database surgery. Full scope in `docs/mvp-definition.md`.

**In scope:** league create / config / invite · snake draft with timer + auto-pick + reconnect (8- and 10-team) · roster validation · weekly lineup lock + partial-week subs · hybrid H2H + VP standings · 4-team playoffs ending before PWHL playoffs · commissioner recovery tools (pause/resume draft, replace manager, force move, undo, audit log) · critical notifications (draft starting, on the clock, lineup incomplete).

**Out of scope for MVP:** trades, waivers, FAAB (may add pre-launch only if implementation risk is low) · keeper / dynasty · referral / growth loops · AI features · native apps.

**Launch gates — all must pass:** rules match implementation · draft reliability validated · VP standings validated · playoff qualification validated · end-to-end season simulation completed · commissioner recovery tools available.

**Immediate — P0 + P1 fixes: RESOLVED ✅ (shipped Jun 20, ahead of Sprint 8 schedule)**

The staff-level code audit (Sprint 6, #37) returned a GO TO BETA verdict with ~8h of P0/P1 fixes
required before real users are invited. All items were applied immediately after Sprint 6 completion:

- **P0-1 Waiver cron** ✅ — `app/api/cron/process-waivers/route.ts` + `vercel.json` cron at 03:00 ET daily. Auth-gated by `CRON_SECRET` header. Ops: env var must be confirmed set in Vercel before launch.
- **P0-2 Auto-set projection safety** ✅ — projection fetch error-handled in `lineup/page.tsx`; `projectionsAvailable` prop disables button when unavailable.
- **P0-3** ✅ — verified: `startSeason()` calls `initializeWaiverPriority()` for all leagues. No change.
- **P1-A** ✅ — `AnalysisTab` shows "Analysis data unavailable. Try refreshing." on null.
- **P1-B** ✅ — `computeOptimalLineup()` falls back to `gamesThisPeriod` when `projectedFp` all null.
- **P1-C** ✅ — `AddAndSlotModal` shows "roster is full, drop a player first" at capacity.
- **P1-E** ✅ — `WaiverWirePanel` two-step inline confirm before cancel.
- **P1-F** ✅ — verified: `getTeamAnalysis()` already fetches fresh `scoringSettings`. No change.
- **174/174 tests pass.** Zero new TypeScript errors.
